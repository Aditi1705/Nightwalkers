            <p>Welcome to Nightwalkers! My name is Elder Kalix and I by the power of ancestors and Moon goddess am here to bless and guide you.
            On your journey being the strongest Alpha, you will encounter bloodthirsty rogues, gain powerful allies, meet your mate and expand you pack.
            I will be with you at every step of your way but you will need to make your decisions wisely as each choice will affect the rest of your journey. 
            When you make your choice, put detail in the choice you take.
